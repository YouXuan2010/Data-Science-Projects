Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Projects
1. [Product Survey Data Analysis](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Product%20Survey%20Data%20Analysis)
   - **Description:** The project conducted data analysis and data mining on the customer survery results about customization of cars
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) for clustering and Association Rule Mining for Market Basket Analysis
   - **Results:** Separated customer in different clusters and found interesting relationship between different interior and exterior components customization
2. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the house price after studying the variables such as location, area, bredroom, bathroom count and many more
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree regressor and Random Forest Regressor
   - **Results:** The Random Forest Regressor performed best with an accuracy of 87.89%
3. [Red Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Red%20Wine%20Quality%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the quality of the wine in the value 0 or 1. 1 represents for good quality wine and 0 represents for bad quality wine
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and K-NN classification
   - **Results:** The logistic regression model performs the best with accuracy of 86.67%
