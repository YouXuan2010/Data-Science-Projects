Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Projects
1. [Product Survey Data Analysis](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Product%20Survey%20Data%20Analysis)
   - **Description:** The project conducted data analysis and data mining on the customer survery results about customization of cars
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) for K-Mode Clustering and Association Rule Mining for Market Basket Analysis
   - **Results:** Separated customer in different clusters and found interesting relationship between different interior and exterior components customization
2. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the house price after studying the variables such as location, area, bredroom, bathroom count and many more
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree regressor and Random Forest Regressor
   - **Results:** The Random Forest Regressor performed best with an accuracy of 87.89%
   - **Tableau Dashboard:** [Link to Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/you.xuan.lim/viz/KingCountyHouseSales_17110320343140/KingCountyHouseSales)
3. [Red Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Red%20Wine%20Quality%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the quality of the wine in the value 0 or 1. 1 represents for good quality wine and 0 represents for bad quality wine
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and K-NN classification
   - **Results:** The logistic regression model performs the best with accuracy of 86.67%
4. [Diamond Price Prediction](https://github.com/YouXuan2010/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Diamond%20Price%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the price (in US dollars) of the diamonds based on their features
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses Descision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor
   - **Results:** The Decision Tree Regresor performed pretty well on the test dataset with an accuracy of 96%
5. [Energy Consumption Time Series Forecast](link_to_your_github_repo)
   - **Description:** This project focuses on forecasting energy consumption using time series data.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebook uses XGBoost Regressor
   - **Results:** The XGBoost Regressor achieved an RMSE of 3726.80 on the test dataset.
