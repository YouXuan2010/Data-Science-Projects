This data science project focuses on forecasting energy consumption using time series data and XGBoost Regressor. By analyzing historical energy consumption patterns and leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast future energy consumption.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains historical records of energy consumption over time. It includes features such as timestamp and energy consumption in MW.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to utilize XGBoost Regressor to build a robust forecasting model for energy consumption. By training the model on past energy consumption data and incorporating additional features, it aims to predict future energy consumption levels accurately.

## Approach
The project follows a systematic approach, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, time-based feature extraction, and model tuning will be employed to prepare the dataset and optimize the forecasting model.

## Impact
Accurate energy consumption forecasting can have significant implications for various stakeholders, including energy providers, policymakers, and consumers. With reliable forecasts, energy providers can optimize resource allocation and plan for future demand effectively. Policymakers can use the insights to implement energy conservation measures and promote sustainable practices. Additionally, consumers can make informed decisions about energy usage, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.

Through this project, valuable insights into energy consumption patterns can be gained, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and contribute to a more sustainable energy future.
